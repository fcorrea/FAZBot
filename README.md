# FAZBot
Cartesian 3D Printer heavily inspired by AlephObject's Lulzbot TAZ 6.
Instead of using alumunum extrusions, the frame is machined in 25mm MDF. It also uses Nema 23 stepper motors (the ones I had available). 

There are two FreeCAD files. One containing all the necessary bodies/models and one just for the assembly.
Entirely designed in FreeCAD 0.18.

The CNC production files were also generated by FreeCAD and tested on a CNC Router running Machinekit.
