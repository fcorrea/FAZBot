Electronics

For this machine I'm going to use what I have at my disposal, which is:

Host System: BeagleBone Black Running Debian 9 with MachineKit (which is great so I can have Samba running and just drop print files over the net)
3D Printer Controler: Replicape Rev B3
Power Source: 24v 15A PSU
Hotend: E3D Titan Extruder direct drive (great for 1.75/3mm filaments)
